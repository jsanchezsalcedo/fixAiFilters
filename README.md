# FIX aiFILTERS CONNECTIONS v0.10
by Jorge Sanchez Salcedo, 2018 

Fix aiFilters connections when, between them, are free slots. Check available slots between filters and re-connect the filters on these slots.

<b>Bugs</b>
路 I have checked the script and works fine but, when it finished gives an Error, don't worry, if you checked the light you could see all the filters connected.

<b>Instructions</b>
路 Copy the script in your scripts project folder.
路 Copy into the script editor this code:
    import fixFilterSlots
    reload(fixFilterSlots)
    fixFilterSlots.FixFilters()
路 Select the code and drag and drop into your shelf.
